                <p>
                    This game's scenarios are fictional. Although the diseases and its descriptions in the 
                    game are real, the "cures" and simple treatment methods of them are oversimplified and
                    should not be used as a guide to cure them in real life. Many diseases back in the day
                    have had no clear treatments and if so, had extreme side effects that ended up worsening
                    the condition. The "cures" were simplified for the purpose of this game.

                <h3>On a serious note!</h3>
                <p>The life of a pirate, though often romanticized in popular culture, was fraught with a 
                    variety of common health issues. These issues resulted from the harsh conditions, poor 
                    diet, and close quarters of life at sea. Some of the health problems frequently experienced 
                    by pirates included:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Scurvy</li>
                    <p>Scurvy was a prevalent and potentially life-threatening condition among pirates due 
                        to their limited access to fresh fruits and vegetables during long sea voyages. The 
                        lack of vitamin C in their diets led to symptoms such as fatigue, gum disease, and 
                        joint pain.</p>
                    <li>Malnutrition</li>
                    <p>The limited and monotonous diet aboard pirate ships often resulted in malnutrition. 
                        Pirates typically consumed preserved and salted foods, which lacked essential nutrients 
                        and contributed to various health problems.</p>
                    <li>Dehydration</li>
                    <p>Staying well-hydrated was a constant challenge at sea, and pirates frequently suffered 
                        from dehydration due to inadequate access to fresh water. Dehydration could lead to 
                        fatigue, dizziness, and other health issues.</p>
                    <li>Infections and Wounds</li>
                    <p>Life on a pirate ship was hazardous, and injuries were common. Infections resulting from 
                        wounds or poor sanitation were significant health concerns, as there were limited medical 
                        resources available.</p>
                    <li>Tooth Decay and Gum Diseases</li>
                    <p>Poor oral hygiene and a diet high in sugar contributed to rampant tooth decay and gum 
                        disease among pirates.</p>
                    <li>Skin Conditions</li>
                    <p>Prolonged exposure to harsh sun and saltwater could lead to various skin conditions, 
                        including sunburn, rashes, and fungal infections.</p>
                    <li>Mental Health</li>
                    <p>The stressful and violent nature of pirate life, along with the challenges of isolation 
                        at sea, took a toll on the mental health of many pirates. Depression, anxiety, and alcohol 
                        addiction were not uncommon</p>
                    <li>Physical Injuries</li>
                    <p>Pirates engaged in frequent battles and confrontations, resulting in physical injuries such 
                        as cuts, bruises, broken bones, and even dismemberment.</p>
